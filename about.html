	<h1>About Nandi</h1>
<h1>Hi I'm Nandi and this is what I want you to know</h1>
    <p>My full name is Nandipha Zulu, and yes I was named after one of South Africa's most famous Zulu Queens.
I'm twenty four years old and I'm originally from Durban. I currently live in Johannesburg, Randburg in an apartment very close to the Art Gallery I work in.
    </p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I love different types of art. 
        I'm a painter myself. If I'm not painting I'm usually listening music and reading 
        a book. I'm a bit of a goth and dont like socializing that much. 
        a book. I'm a bit of a goth and dont like socializing that much. I love watering my plants(I'm a plant mom) and I love riding my motorcycle around the city whenever I have free time and it is therapeutic because the drive helps clear my head and releives me from stress from my daily life. I love going onto instagram to 
    read poems and poetry.
I love fashion and believe black is my go-to when it comes to different occassion. You can never go wrong with black. I can wear black when I need to go to work and look professional and I have casual black clothes when I want to go out or when I attended classes before Covid.
My favorite spots in Johannesburg are usually coffee shops, I'm addicted to Salted Caramel Ice Lattes they are amazing and my other favorite hang-out spot is Rosebank.
</p>
<h2>Favourite Foods</h2>
<p>My favorite home cooked meals are Creamy Garlic Shrimp Pasta and Bacon wrapped potatoes.
   My favorite dessert is home made brownies with vanilla ice cream.
   My favorite fast food restaurants has to be Ocean Basket and MacDonalds.
   My favorite Asian restaurant in Johannesburg is Saigon Suzy in Parkwood. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are interested in eating different Asian food including Korean KFC burgers and Bun Chai which a bowl of noodles, salad and different types of meats, it's amazing.
</p>
     <h2>My Job</h2>

        <p>Well not many people know me in the city because I'm more of an indoor person
            but I'm an junior art consultant for  rich families that live here in Johannesburg, Sandton. I usually spend time
            at the front of my laptop and get phone calls from work telling me what do I think about 
            art pieces from different South African artists and whether any clients would be interested 
            in these specific artworks. It's really fun since I get to look at different artworks and try and 
            feel the depth and emotions through the paintings. But I hope these rich families see the beauty of these
            artworks instead of thinking of it as new house decorations but hey a girl's gotta get paid lol. I have a private contact number in case any clients want to book private consultant times with me and my boss.

        </p>
    <h2>Random Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>I'm obsessed with tattoos, I have two tattoos myself but I'm obsessed with tattoo designs I think tattoos are another form of Art.
        My favorite place in the world is the beach at night because it's actually very calming and an easy place to be in my thought.
