	<h1>About Nandi</h1>
<h1>Hi I'm Nandi and this is what I want you to know</h1>
    <p>My full name is Nandipha Zulu, and yes I was named after one of South Africa's most famous Zulu Queens.
I'm twenty four years old and I'm originally from Durban. I currently live in Johannesburg, Randburg in an apartment very close to the Art Gallery I work in.
    </p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I love different types of art. 
        I'm a painter myself. If I'm not painting I'm usually listening music and reading 
        a book. I'm a bit of a goth and dont like socializing that much. 
        a book. I'm a bit of a goth and dont like socializing that much. I love watering my plants(I'm a plant mom) and I love riding my motorcycle around the city whenever I have free time and it is therapeutic because the drive helps clear my head and releives me from stress from my daily life. I love going onto instagram to 
    read poems and poetry.
I love fashion and believe black is my go-to when it comes to different occassion. You can never go wrong with black. I can wear black when I need to go to work and look professional and I have casual black clothes when I want to go out or when I attended classes before Covid.
My favorite spots in Johannesburg are usually coffee shops, I'm addicted to Salted Caramel Ice Lattes they are amazing and my other favorite hang-out spot is Rosebank.
</p>
<h2>Favourite Foods</h2>
<p>My favorite home cooked meals are Creamy Garlic Shrimp Pasta and Bacon wrapped potatoes.
   My favorite dessert is home made brownies with vanilla ice cream.
   My favorite fast food restaurants has to be Ocean Basket and MacDonalds.
   My favorite Asian restaurant in Johannesburg is Saigon Suzy in Parkwood. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are interested in eating different Asian food including Korean KFC burgers and Bun Chai which a bowl of noodles, salad and different types of meats, it's amazing.
</p>
     <h2>My Job</h2>

        <p>Well not many people know me in the city because I'm more of an indoor person
            but I'm an junior art consultant for  rich families that live here in Johannesburg, Sandton. I usually spend time
            at the front of my laptop and get phone calls from work telling me what do I think about 
            art pieces from different South African artists and whether any clients would be interested 
            in these specific artworks. It's really fun since I get to look at different artworks and try and 
            feel the depth and emotions through the paintings. But I hope these rich families see the beauty of these
            artworks instead of thinking of it as new house decorations but hey a girl's gotta get paid lol. I have a private contact number in case any clients want to book private consultant times with me and my boss.

        </p>
    <h2>Random Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>I'm obsessed with tattoos, I have two tattoos myself but I'm obsessed with tattoo designs I think tattoos are another form of Art.
        My favorite place in the world is the beach at night because it's actually very calming and an easy place to be in my thought.

	<h2>Wireframes in Light Of The UX And UI Theories:</h2>
    <p>My old wireframe designs were actually experimental designs on how I wanted my website to be at first. But these new ones titled New Wireframe Designs are more explanatory compared to my first ones. Therefore, they are more useful in terms of explaining wireframes and the use of the UI and UX theories that I have used in my theory blog posts section. My first wireframe is the design for the homepage of my website. The second one is the design for the About page of my website. The third design is for the portfolio for my character. The fourth design is for the theory blogs section of my website. The fifth design was created for the creative blogs for my character as well as some artworks. The final design is for the contact page of my website and how to contact my character. These wireframes are all a part of the design process in the user interface that which is a design that is systematic, information-oriented visual design which is seen in different html and pages on my website that contain different information, information that is verbal and visual. The design process produces a sophisticated computer-based for their specific target market whether it is business or personal. For example, my website is a personal website for my character in terms of having wireframes for my characters about page and my character’s creative blogs where my character explains their interests and hobbies. Whereas the pages that are business related for my character are the contact page and the portfolio page showing a description of my character and rationale. These wireframes are available to accessible to anyone with the world wide web.  These wireframes for the website can contain information. The wireframes in terms of metaphor design and user interface are linked together to address verbal and visual communication. The wireframes are a part of the design process in order to come with the final outcome. The wireframes help form a type of communication and navigation for computer applications in order to satisfy the users wants and needs. The wireframes in a way are part of the algothrims that create the perfect product.  (Marcus, 1998) The UX part of the wireframes help make the website usable and useful the website is. The practice and design of the wireframes depends on the goal whether to make the viewers happy or sad or create any emotion that is the creator’s goal for the website. For example, my website is supposed to give a peaceful and artistic aesthetic which is why I was selective in terms of colour theme, character design and images that I have proved for my website because the target market are people interested in art. The usability is the main core intention of the object or website. The pages have a specific use and was planned to use the wireframe. The UX only exists in the mind of the user or creator therefore the wireframes were what comes to mind when creating the website at first before carefully planning and creating new wireframes that match the idea of what was on my mind. The UX is actually the user experience and how viewers of the website feel about the website and what kind of emotions do they get when viewing the website. The wireframes help with the user experience because the visual and verbal design help with the user experience. Since the touch point of the website is to match my character’s personality the wireframes are important because it is designed in a way to provide the correct information and pages and HTMLs needed that I feel are necessary to describe my character’s personality, interests, and occupation as well as educational history as well as a part of her social life.</p>

	<h2>Reasoning behind decision making</h2>
	<section>
    <p>There were certain colour chosen out of all these other colours because my character's inspired by Raven Teen Titans therefore there purple and lilac were the top choices for my website but i wanted a colour theme
		that gave an artistic, calming and aesthetically pleasing feel to my website because my character is into black and purple an she is an introvert. I anted an introvert perfect for a calm itroverted gothic character.
