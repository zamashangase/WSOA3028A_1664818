    <h1>Week1: The Library of Babel</h1>
	<article> 
		
    <p>The Library of Babel:
        In the beginning of this reading, the author considers the universe as a composed hexagonal gallery that has infinite numbers, and the universe is also called the Library.  In this library there are twelve bookshelves. The author describes the bookshelves and talks about men of the library back in his days. The libraries are considered a sphere with hexagon shaped centers, each hexagon is furnished with five different bookshelves. Each book is different, but thirty-two books have identical formats and contains four hundred and ten pages. Each page of the books has forty lines and exactly eight black lines. The front of each book has letters. The library has always existed. It is considered a future eternity of the world to the author. Man is the imperfect librarian in a universe with appointments that are elegant in it’s bookshelves. The library has staircases for it’s travelers and readers, a seat for the librarian as well as the water closets. This library is the perfect handwork of God.
         There is a theory about the Library. It is believed that the ancient people were librarians that created a language. This reading firstly discusses the universe as a place of knowledge and mankind as readers, preservers and protectors of this place of knowledge. The reading constantly speaks of the hexagon symbol having an importance use in the reading and the Library itself. The reading then goes on in how to find books and praying to an unknown god that someday that book will be read by someone. Someone believe that the library is nonsense.
        The Garden of Forking Paths:
        This is a book that can read in multiple ways by the reader and the storyline comes in seven layers. The author describes the theory of the universe in this book. The author describes the universe as a place where everything is possible and that it is philosophy with motivated actions represented by the protagonist of the book. The book speaks about issues such as race, espionage, war, ancestry, and other historical events. 
        These two books were compared to each other and have similar ideas. The reading continues speaking about the events in the book or storyline.  (Borges, 1941)
        The Library of Babel
        It is said that methodical components and compositions distract the author from the current condition of humanity then the author speaks of the distress of mankind and the extinction of these books as time goes on. If a traveler were to travel in any direction, he would find out that the end of journey will have the same repeated history and discord.(Borges, 1998)
        The Garden of Forking Paths:
        
        Conclusion 
        In conclusion I believe that the library of Babel speaks of the fear of losing ancient discoveries and knowledge in books from the infinite universal library and of mankind being doomed to repeat the same discord.  but also speaks beautifully of the mysteries of the universe found in this library and it’s books as well as mankind serving as travelers and librarians. The Garden of Forking Paths has been compared and has similar concepts in terms of speaking about the beauty of books and the knowledge that they have. Both described as universes,  where everything is possible and the historical events as well as ancestry of ancient mankind are both noticed in both books

        <h1>Week2: As We Think At 65</h1>
		<article>
        <p>The reflection on one of the historical articles provided:
            This reading by Simon Harper is about Bush’s ‘As We Think at 65’ and his research on his digital idea for future technologies. The reading discusses that it has been 65 years since the visionary paper of Vannevar Bush which was published and became a new field of study for the new generation that wish to study writing, art, and computer science. The reading goes into detail about Bush’s backstory before he created the As We Think at 65 reading at the age of 35. Bush was surveying his Differential Analyzer at MIT in the year 1927. This analyzer was a computer that had the ability to solve different equations with at least 18 different variables. This computer was one of the first mechanical devices that could be used operationally. Although Bush was developing his analyzer, he refused to move to digital technologies even though it was being developed in the same institution he was working in. This was because his mindset was merely focused on the physical linkage and change which is why he preferred MEMEX, a system which relied and focused on physical analogue. Bush speaks about a futuristic device for individuals that can be used as a personal and private library. MEMEX helps stores an individual’s books, communications as well as his records. Bush’s idea has said to be the first inspiration for the World Wide Web as it was written in his article in 1945 by the Atlantic Monthly. Bush wanted his computer system to help humanity and he wanted the computer to be able to adapt to humanity needs and serve humanity. Bush’s idea is to make his technology understand the human mind. The web provides human with massive amount of information. In ‘As We Think at 65’, Bush shows how information can be managed based on each individual’s experience. Bush states that science is a simple faith and that it is a privilege that mankind has the ability to learn and understand.(Harper, 2010)
           
            <h3>Bonus Post: The Promise of User Generated Content:</h3>
			The promise and peril of User Generated Content:
    User generated content fall under these three categories, videos, pictures, or texts. User generated content can be blog posts like this one. Video content, Q&A forums, case studies, reviews, and social media content. It is content created by any user online such as Instagram posts and tweets from Twitter. User generated content can be use for strategic marketing and gain control over your brand and image. For example, brands use Instagram to promote and share images of their products and influencers get paid by brands whenever they promote their products on their social media pages. User generated content can be used as marketing campaigns, it can also be used to provide people with news that has not be announced on news or make people aware of what is happening in the world. This gives people access to different types of information and different opinions from different people about different topics. Reviews help people see the results of the product from previous users and whether they had  a positive or negative experience with that product.

        <h1>Week3: Semantic Markup</h1>
		<article>
        <h2>Semantic Markup- what is it? And why is it necessary?</h2>

           <p> The semantic markup is the use of the markup language, for example the HTML. It contains information about different elements and the meaning behind each element in a document. It also has a selection of markup elements and it separates the markup from the visual presentation of the elements that are in the documents. The semantic markup is very necessary for the HTML elements which also enhances the searchability, accessibility, interoperability, and internationalization. Therefore, the semantic markup is mandatory if you want visitors to have access to your website. This also includes access for visitors around the world and to achieve the high search engine ranking. It also interfaces with other web pages and web services. When writing a semantic markup, you are creating web content that is readable to computers and human beings. The computer now can analyze the content written, it then delivers it and then index it and developers can put together different information into web services that are new.
            The word Semantic, refers to the meaning of a word or sentence and it’s interpretation.  When a word is misused then it is not being used semantically. The semantic markup is linked to the one of many HTML tags, it contains information about the opening and closing tags.  Even with very good CSS it still makes a bad markup invisible to the website visitors. But even styling will not make the bad markup meaningful to visitors that are computerized such as the browser translation tools, assistive technologies such as the screen readers and the search engine web crawlers. There are two practices that can enable the semantic markup and must be put into place. The first practice requires the semantic markup and it’s HTML elements to be used according to their main purpose. The second practice requires the semantic markup to separate the presentation and the content. (Lawson, 2020)
        <h3>Bonus Post: What Is A Browser And How Do They Work?</h3>
			What is a browser and how do they work?
    A browser is a piece of software used to give humans access to the internet. It contains a variety of human knowledge and information. Browser grants people access to browse any website and helps navigate users to any other websites available to the public. An example of a popular browser is Google Chrome. The web browser works by sending information or data and receiving it. The data is then transferred using the http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) this method helps observe things that have been texted, images and videos that have been transported around the world wide web. Browsers also send and receive information by using the backsend. The backsend sends people’s requests across the internet and carries the information that was received back is then connected and interacts with the websites that people want to visit. To display the information visually onto computers, the browser will feature a user interface which is also known as the frontend.  Which allows people to click, scroll and navigate around websites. (Wardrip-Fruin, 2004)

        <h1>Week4: How Does The Medium As The Message Impact Our Understanding of the Web?</h1>
        <p>How Does The Medium Is The Message Impact Our Understanding of the Web?
            Firstly, the medium is the message by McLuhan was created before he, the author predicted the creation of the World Wide Web thirty years before it was invented. It helps understand the medium of the internet which is an extension of ourselves as human beings. The web serves as a form of communication with mediums such as emails, social media applications and websites.  McLuhan states that people are prone to use social media as a medium that can be used as scapegoat for the sins of those in front of their technology screens. Therefore, this reading shows the people have a form of power over technologies and what they use it for, whether they use their social media and other mediums for good use or for guilt, pleasure and evil. An example for evil use of the Web id the Dark Web which uses the internet for illegal uses such as selling illegal weapons and other sells that are harmful to other human beings. How you as a user use the internet is up to you but there are consequences to users that use the Web for negative impact towards others. It is common for human beings to develop mental breakdowns when trying to process new information as a result to adapting to times changing including new technology adaptions and creations. Technology has changed the way we communicate with others; it is way for human beings to send messages faster than before. Messages are instantly delivered but the way the message is written is important otherwise it might be perceived in the wrong context for example some people who are used to emojis expressing how they feel will perceive a message being sent without emojis means that the person who sent the message is being serious or lacks a sense of humor depending on the topic being discussed. The word content is important when interacting on the internet because no one can fully understand how you feel through the messages. Messages change the concept and changes the impact of the shape and content it was delivered. We as human beings miss the structural impact the messages as a medium have on our social and professional affairs. For example, when sending an email that is work related you must sound professional and serious compared to an email that you send to a family and friends. The scholar is trying to address the impact of how messages effect our way of communicating and that the internet can be used for good and evil purposes, but both still have consequences depending on the subject matter of the conversation. The scholar is implying that we as human must use the internet in a responsible manner and with great power comes great responsibility. The internet is our new source of information as well as communication. The key arguments of the article is the impact of the internet has on society and how it dominates our way of living as well as interaction with other people. (McLuhan, 1964)

        <h1>Week5:What Interactivity Means To The WWW?</h1>
		<article>
        <p>What interactivity means to the www
            Before going into what interactivity means to the world wide web, we need to have an understanding of the world wide web. The world wide web is a comprehensive example of a hypermedia system. Hypermedia systems are based on the same model of information spaces that are collections of resources that are interlinked.
            According to Aaron Smuts, something is only interactive only if it responsive, is not completely controlled, does not completely controlled, and doesn’t respond in a random fashion. Authors such as Lev Manovich and Espen Aarseth both try to avoid the word ‘interactive’ in their readings. Aarseth prefers to use the word ‘ergodic’ and defines interactive or ergodic literature as texts where effort is required in order for the reader to traverse the text. Lev Manovich avoids the word interactive because the concept for the word is too broad and useful. An object is represented in a computer and then becomes interactive. Meaning that when you put something on the internet then it becomes a part of the world wide web. But calling computer media interactive is meaningless, this means that stating the simple facts about computers. User input results in output such as events. An example of an event is the user interface events. These events occur as the given results of any interactions with the browser window instead of the HTML page. It resizes and scrolls.
            The second event is the Mouse event. These types of events only fire when the mouse moves and also when the user clicks a button. Although these actions work differently depending on the types of touchscreen devices. For the mouse events the movement of the mouse itself involves clicking, double clicking, mouse down, mouse up, mouse over, mouse move and mouse out. From my understanding the use of the mouse is important towards interacting with the world wide web as this device helps the user move around the world wide web. 
            The third event is the Keyboard events. This event fires on any type of device when the computer user interacts with a keyboard.  The most important buttons on the keyboard during interactions are the input, keypress, key up and the key down. These buttons also help with movement around the World wide web.
            The fourth event is the Form events. These events are considered common when using forms on the webpages. The one that we are looking at in particular is the submit event which mostly comes in forms of validation also known as checking form values. The form event process includes submitting, change and input.
            All these user events are not the same or equal. But they are indeed responsive, respond in a non-random way. Users should care about this procedure because we are in business with manipulation. This manipulation includes controlling your user, creating meaning, subvert meaning and the manipulation of directing their actions as well as dictating their actions.
            In conclusion in my opinion, interactivity helps users move around the world wide web in order to go where they want to go including visiting webpages. These events are important in the interactivity process, in a way they are a form of direction and navigation for users to reach their destination.

			<h1>Week6: Reflection on the reading on User Experience </h1>
			<article>
			<p>The User experience has had an early attempt to define the UX. The readings claim Alben had once identified beauty and aesthetics as an important part and quality of technology. But beauty clearly goes beyond the instrumental. It is important because beauty is a part of the human wants and needs. (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2011). The reading goes into UX research which goes into recognition of affects and emotions and this research shows a human side has a certain consequence and use of technology. UX research involves human emotions and affects using technology. UX research has mainly focused on positive human emotions such as fun, pride, happiness, and joy. An example of technology, that experiments with positive emotions is the Gust bowl. This was designed to communicate with parents and children. This technology, Gust bowl was revealed to have emotional rituals. The given examples in the readings implicate that the Gust Bowl is a technology that focuses on the relationships and communications between family members. Mainly it focuses on experimenting communication between parents and their children. The reading also explains the motivational user interface in call center software. (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2011). The readings explain negative interactions between call agents and their customers. So far, the readings explain human wants and needs as well as human communication amongst each other. This section in the readings explains the emotional and affective response to user interface, experience, and technologies. There two emotions that deal with UX. The experiential section of this reading discusses the two UX aspects of technology. These are the situatedness and the temporarily. The experience is a combination of elements which is used to create products that are in the interest of the user. For example, it creates the product by researching and finding the user’s active goals, motivation, mood, and expectations. These elements are interrelated. Therefore, the elements interact and modify each other. The outcome of this process is the experience itself. Experiments have advantages. There are experimental outcomes that produces a positive impact on the user. These experiences have a beginning as well as an end.  This also inspires emotional change and behavioral change. This experience promotes products by ‘a constant stream of self-talk’. Communication and behavioral studies are seen in this reading. The readings to my understanding are a research process that shows there is a need to take steps in order to experiment and create a user experience. The process includes researching human emotions, needs and wants as well as using technologies to find data with technologies and experiments in order to collect data. This data is then used to produce products that benefits the user’s needs and wants.  There are a lot of questions and challenges that show that the user experience is complex to a certain extent. This is because the user experience research process uses different users and their human emotions, but humans are different and react to things differently. What gives one person a positive impact gives another a neutral impact towards their different perspective towards these experiences. (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2011)

			<h1>Week7: A reflection of the Metaphor Design for User Interface</h1>
			<article>
			<p>User Interface is the embodiment of data and the functions of the computer-based products. There is a basis of the commercial success and the product’s usability. The user interface design helps with the novice user. The novice user becomes an expert user, in order to be an expert, it endures intense training that becomes useful for the novice in time. The important part of the design process in the user interface is the systematic, information-oriented visual design. This design process produces sophisticated computer-based for international consumers, domestics, and business markets. The metaphor design has concept that are fundamental, as well as images and terms that have information that is easily understood, remembered, and recognized. This design includes essentials with choices for control and command which communicates the data of all statuses and functions. There are metaphorical techniques that can change over times and across the systems. Metaphors can achieve their effectiveness through these techniques and the organization and its associations. These associations include the objects, classes, structures, and the attributions. The operation for the metaphor design is the algorithms, recipes, and processes. The reading goes into detail about the few example of the metaphorical context and certain physical objects such as documents, applications, data, and the computer itself. Other physical objects such as the desk, documents, photography, network, and the games that are in the desktop of the computer. (Marcus, 1998). The metaphor design is also in the desktop that was popularized by Apple and Xenox. It contains office references such as desktops, documents, and folders. This is mixed with the build references such as trash cans and windows. The metaphorical references which have enrichments of the new references which occur all of the time. More researchers need to explore the future culturally diverse metaphors. These metaphors have an impact on communication, they evaluate the effectiveness and the design process itself. This process achieves simple communication and clear and better solutions. These solutions will bring more diverse information products for users nation wide and internationally. In order for the product to be successful, the developers of the user interface for tools that are productive, the world wide web and the multimedia. These must be carefully planned, be implemented with the user interface metaphors, and have the design analyzed. The metaphors have to be good to the users and the information needs to be remembered easily and quickly. The user’s expectations are managed with a sense of satisfaction. It also manages the user’s delight and surprise as well as the comprehension. The reading also addresses the visual verbal communication. The examples of these concepts of actions and the embodiments are creation, movement, deleting, scanning, location, select and evaluation. In my opinion, the metaphor design is a form of communication and navigation for computer applications in order to satisfy user needs and wants. The design process has a lot of steps such as algothrims and recipes to help guide and create the perfect product for users. It also explains the important uses of the computer and these objects are needed as well as what they are for.

			<h1>Week8: Towards A Study of information geographies reading.</h1>
			<article>
			<p>The readings start of with the pre-digital geographies of information., then changing geographies after the information revolution and different other topics such as geographies of access and enablement, geographies of participation and geographies of representation. The aim of the pre-digital geographies of information is the technologies before digital technologies which is why it is called the pre-digital geographies. This period of time had systems that collected geographical information. An example of geographical technologies during the nineteenth century are compasses, sextants, and paper. Books are another example of a form with geographical information. Pre-digital technologies had codified information and gives information on tools used for geographies before modern technologies came along for humanity. Books and newspapers were published and delivered all over the world or continent to inform people about their surroundings except for Africa which was left to technological Apartheid.  This section aims to give readers information about geographies before pre-digital technologies. (Graham, 2015)
				The aim of the changing geographies after the information revolution is the changes of ways that information that is produced and used. This revolution has brought a transformation in that way of information. The systems that are a part of this new information age are computers. These computers are used to receive information that is political, social, and economic. For example, for political information is when a computer user wants to research political information about their country and different other countries. Political information can include the change of a president in a country such as the President of the United States. People from different countries are updated on presidential campaigns and polls until a new president is announced. Social information can include the use of computers for users to socialize with other internet users using social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram. These can be used to communicate with different people in the same countries or different countries. The economic information in computers can be used to search the user’s countries’ economic system for example, users can check the countries current currency and employment rate. Computers allows users access to limited information and knowledge depending on the computer settings. (Graham, 2015)
				The aim of the geographies of access and enablement is the important insight into the distribution of technologies. It services digital communication, participation, and representation. Data is then analyzed using the hexagon-shaped cartogram in order to determine a country’s access to computers using the population of the country’s users. (Graham, 2015). The aim of the geographies of participation is to explore the domain names such as GitHub users and Wikipedia editors. This type of participation includes the representation of global communities. There are different domain names in different countries. These highlight the purposes of the user’s participation in domain names and social media platforms. This part of the reading goes into detail about different countries and their domain names. (Graham, 2015). The aim of geographies of representation is in the digital representations such as Google Search, OpenStreetMap, and the Semantic Web. Google Search is the world’s largest search engine, OpenStreetMap is the world’s largest map, and the Semantic Web is the world’s largest knowledge bases. In my opinion in terms of representation google search helps users find the different countries and their cultures and history. OpenStreetMap helps users locate a countries location in the world-wide map. Semantic Web helps users with researching a selective piece of knowledge requested by the user in order to have in tell and new information. (Graham, 2015). The conclusion of this reading goes into detail about the different geographies of digital information.

			<h1>Week9: Reflection on what is Geography and why does it matter?</h1>
			<article>
			<p>Geography is information that is used to implicate how mankind produce spaces. Geography is a source of information. But firstly, to begin geography information, one has to look into historical maps and how these illustrates the geographic information and limitations. Geography maps are used to have information of the world. Maps also have transmission of information on people and their movements and communicating this knowledge. The reading has the information on the world’s oldest map and navigational chart. This map is from the thirteenth century and it is called the Carta Pisana. This is an Italian map. (Graham, 2014). Geographies are a form of knowledge even when uneven, theses maps are important to examine because they show representations of places that are virtual. These places are implicated for people to experience and produced places to explore. The term ‘augmented realities’ is used to describe unstable, determined context and multiple realities which are brought together within time. Uneven geographies of information that are seen can be shaped in what can be known and what is known. The myriad ways are influenced by knowledge that is produced, enacted, reproduced, and re-enacted. Geography maps have been used from Italian culture to the Middle Ages. Geography maps are published in published books, publications, and patents. In my own opinion, Geography is a part of human history and has been used to navigate people throughout history. Maps have geographical information which leads people to their destination. The internet navigates people to what they have searched or shows different websites and directs you to the website with the information you are looking for. Nowadays geographies have been used for the Internet and online information. It matters because it used for Internet infrastructure and internet access. There are actual geographies in internet infrastructure. Although there are different parts of the world that do not have physical connection with the rest of the world and global grid. (Graham, 2014). Modern day geographies are now used for Internet applications such as Google Maps and Google Earth. Google has information from people about the world, there are layers of information that surrounds us as human beings. These places can be searched in different languages depending on the user’s home language making it useful for almost everyone because google translate isn’t one hundred percent. For example, it roughly translates African languages such as Zulu. (Graham, 2014). The reading goes into further detail about different countries such as Africa and the Netherlands. There are different data shadows and articles per person in each country. (Graham, 2014). These articles are found in countries such as Africa well most parts of the continent and it’s countries. South America and Asia have contrasted the characterization of small numbers of articles per person. Page Ten in the reading has an image of what maps look like. It is a representation of historical and geographical maps. The map has an average number of edits from Wikipedia. The map shows countries such as North America and Latin America and others.</p>

			<h1>Week10: Ethics of UX Practice</h1>
			<article>
			<p>The UX is connected to usability which is connected to how easy it is to use objects and how usable an object is. The UX practice deprives from the lack of usability because usability is the main core intention of designed objects. The UX practice can be any type of experience whether it is happiness or sadness. The UX only exists in the mind of the user, the UX does not identify as an object but instead it is the user’s experience. In my understanding the UX is found mainly what the user finds enjoyable depending on their state of mind towards the object. The user experience is a result of the interactions with the object. The UX is the result of the user and how the user interacts with the design object. In my opinion the UX practice is how the user experiences a product or service and then the user gives feedback about their experience with the product and how it can improve. The interact and feedback contains how the user’s experience was emotionally, mentally and their reaction. The object is important in the UX practice. The use of users for user experience is optional in this practice but I feel like it is important to include users in order to improve their product. In terms of this reading relating to my character for my website. My character is an art consultant and shows artworks to potential clients and buyers, but my character is the user in this situation as she observes the products or objects and decides whether it is good enough to exhibit in the art gallery that she works in. this week’s reading actually links towards the reading I did for Week Six. That reading also talks about the User Experience and reflects on that reading. There are different types of user experiences for example, singular experience which results in the touch point and the accumulated experience is a result of all the singular experiences altogether. The touch point of the product is the desire and needs of human beings which was also explained in the reading I did for week six. These desires and needs are what makes the touch point, the users have the power to spread the news of this product to the world in order for this product to gain more users and still receive feedback. The morality of the UX is the discipline of the early efforts that are driven by the desire of the improving of the human experience and the productivity while reducing the errors of the products. There are three types of UX ethics, existential values. These values go beyond a feature and the product that is within the design and it is closely rooted in the product itself. For example, whoever you work for do you agree with their ethics and values and what they stand for? For example, my character works for an art gallery and has to agree with the way they receive and present the product to users or in this case potential clients.</p>

			<h1>Week11: Critical Analysis On My Own UX And UI In Light of All Readings</h1>
			<article>
			<p>My own UX and UI for my character’s job is the selling of artworks to potential buyers. According to week ten’s reading about the ethics of the UX practice. The process depends on the user’s experience towards the product and what kind of feeling that the user experienced towards that product. The products in my character’s case are the artworks in the gallery that are exhibited. The artworks give different observers different emotions and feelings. Artworks impact people in different ways whether happiness or sadness or confusion art impact people in different ways. The feedback in this case is the observers side comments on the paintings or the conversations between my character and the buyers and how they feel towards that specific artwork. Feedback can also be used for what kind of artworks observers in art galleries want to see or which artists artworks they want to see more of. Feedback can be negative as much as it can be positive. For example, observers can feel negative towards a specific artist or their artworks for example some historic artworks can be sensitive to certain observers. There is a lot of interaction towards the artworks/products and the users/observers in the art gallery. The main goal of the UX practice is to produce an object the satisfies the human needs and wants. In conclusion for my character’s website, it is to show my character’s interests, occupation, and talents.  The UI for my character’s website. UI is user interface and is the human-first approach to the designing of the aesthetic experience of a product. This mainly focuses on the digital product which is the website that shows images of digital artworks by a digital artist. The UI on the website is the typography, color palette for the theme for the website style guide, the buttons and images on the website that reflect what time of work the character is doing as well as the character’s interests.  The website allows potential buyers and clients to view what type of artworks the character promotes and recommends as well as the occupation of the character. It appears in a certain aesthetic. The UI design has to be aesthetically pleasing. The UI is the presentation of the website and how it easily reflects how the character is and reflects the personality of the character and gives viewers insight on what kind of person the character is. Looking into the reading I did for week seven on the metaphor design for user interface, user interface is the embodiment of data and functions of digital technologies. The important part of the design process is the user interface and how it is the systematic, information-oriented visual design that helps user find the website if they are looking for my character or observing what type of person my character is. The design process is for the producing sophisticated digital-based products for business markets, domestics, and international consumers. The design also needs an algothrims in order to plan the website and write down a list of things that are needed in the website and the design process also includes planning a website that is perfect for my character and matches the description of the character profile and easily gives a perfect description and visual design to represent the character’s personality.</p>

			<h1>Week12: Looking At A List of Tweets, Articles, And Things In The Theory Section</h1>
			<article>
			<p>The article that I will be looking into I will be giving a critical reflection on their issue that they have raised while reflecting on the work that has been done in the course and the readings supplied. As well as additional research that I have done.
				The article that will be discussed is an article about Discovery Health denies targeting black doctors. Discovery Health had given a public statement on the matter claiming that these rumors were false, fraud, waste and abusive. These allegations have claimed that these medical aid schemes have been racially profiling black and Indian medical practitioners in Centurion. An area located in Gauteng. Discovery Health has admitted to flagging out and investigating black doctors than their white doctors because of past cases where doctors have committed crimes to assist their poor patients. In my opinion, this statement is racial profiling to a certain extent because why do more investigation on medical practitioners because of the colour of their skin? It is a bit unfair that hard working Indian and black doctors must suffer or be punished by past employees. Although given that the statement claims the doctors have committed crimes to help poor patients? What are these crimes? And a doctor’s main purpose is to aid the ill. Although those previous doctors that have committed crimes could have recommended cheaper health care instead of committing crimes. Even Chairperson of Section 59 Investigation Advocate, Tembeka Ngcukaitobi asks the same questions that I have asked when reading the first part of this article. Broomberg gave a statement that there a high portion of black doctors that help poor patients which in my opinion doesn’t give them a right to investigate only people of colour especially in a country where the majority of the population is black. This is racial profiling to a certain extent. In terms of character relating to this article, my character is also a person of colour and in a country like South Africa. Racial profiling should be a thing of the past especially since the population is 90% people of colour. Broomberg defends his statement by claiming that the business is trying to protect themselves from abuse of power and fraud. This article can reflect on the reading for Week 9 that I did on What Is Geography and why does it matter? The article can be found in Google search if the user is in the South African region, and it can be recommended for local news. This article is on the internet and is accessible to anyone in world that search Discovery Health and read about this scandal about racial profiling and how they selectively pick and investigate their staff by the racial group. If Discovery Health has international clients, this scandal could make lose clients depending on which racial group these clients belong to. Broomberg also claimed in another article that found while researching. He claims that the number of black doctors are the same as the white doctors but they do examine on these practioners.

			<h2>Bonus Post: The Criminal Machine Learning</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
                 Engineer researchers known as Xi Zhang and Xiaolin Wu did an article on identifying criminals through face scans. In their article these researchers make use of these machines learning how to identify criminals by scanning their facial features. In my opinion, so far this idea is interesting but also a bit of a bad idea because these machines can identify criminals, but the human face isn’t exactly original. For example, I read somewhere on Instagram that a man with the same name, surname and face as a criminal was mistaken for that criminal until that criminal was caught months later. There is a believe that no one’s face is original and that even one has a twin in the world that is not biologically related to them. These machines help find the difference between criminal and non -criminal facial features. The reading claims that if identifying criminals from facial structure was the only option then it could cause an ethical challenge. Back in the nineteenth century, Doctor Lombroso studied the anatomy of criminals because of trying to understand the scientific logic of criminality. His research has come to a conclusion that criminals were born with both psychological drives and their physical features. Lombroso implies that from his research that a criminal can be identified by the shape of his jawline, the size of their eyes and the size of the forehead. In my opinion, these methods are racially degrading to some extent because it does not matter if some police officers are provided with this technology because some police officers believe all black people are dangerous or intimidating which is the Black Lives Matter movement was created to fight police brutality and racial profiling and also sometimes you cannot use the word of a witness because some witnesses are the actual killers themselves or the actual criminals trying to cover their tracks. Instead of a machine that only identifies by facial features but also use any evidence from the crime scene as well just in case. These engineer researchers rechecked Lombroso’s idea which was shut down due to his racist ideas. Wu and Zhang revisited this idea based on the simple headshot and the program distinguished that the experiment between criminal and non-criminal faces by 90%. The algothrims that they used was identifying a criminal using the photos of over 1,800 photos of Chinese men aged between 18-55 and none of these men had any similar features such as tattoos, scars, and facial hair. (Criminal Machine Learning, 2016)
                 These images came from sources such as the World Wide Web, these images are from professional pages where the authors know the educational backgrounds and occupation of every person on this webpage. Out of the 1,800 photos in this site only 700 people in this website have a criminal record according to the police department. In my opinion, South Africa should have a website like this because too many sex offenders are employed because their employers are unaware of their past, and it can be unsafe environment for women like my character. South Africa is country known for gender-based violence and is considered one of the highest-ranking rape capitals in the world so women like my character, Nandi are not safe. But my character is a person of colour which in a country where almost ninety percent of the country is African but even African police officers are known for racial profiling, police brutality and abusing their power to harm its citizens. But not all police officers are like this but this the reality of South Africa especially when women of colour record their violators on camera. This is because they need evidence in a country where the police do not believe them. (Criminal Machine Learning, 2016)

			<h1>Week13: The Radical Al Podcast- LOVE, CHALLENGE AND HOPE: Building A Movement To Dismantle The New Jim Code</h1>
			<article>
				<p>The podcast discussing the building of a movement on love and hope. I was listening to this podcast and they were talking about The podcast discussing the building of a movement on love and hope. I was listening to this podcast, and they were interviewing Doctor Benjamin who does African American studies in Harvard University and her work investigates the social dimensions of science, medicine, and technology. The interview speaks about racism in technology. Can robots be racists? Before going into the main topic, they ask doctor, Benjamin about her backstory and how she was as an undergraduate. She studied black women’s roles in medicine and technology. She speaks on the medicine department’s treatment of black women including childbirth and birth control. She speaks about stem cell research in California. She was one of the first students to study stem cell research. Her most recent work focuses on race and cast being incorporated into the field. She speaks on racial dynamics in the scientific field. Although stem cell research is towards the biological study, she still found interest in the research despite what field she was engaging with. She speaks on her journey of changing sciences. She wrote a book and asked people this question: Are robots racist? Technology which was created by humans. The podcast recommends the book to the listeners. Benjamin says racism in robots has a certain extent if the creator makes the robot target a specific population. She then goes to say that there are specific rules that the creators must follow to avoid this from happening. In my opinion if robots are created by humans, then they learn from their masters, or their creators program the racist trait into their programming. A robot cannot just decide to be racist as they either witness these actions from other people or they learn from it from somewhere. There is a saying that no one can be born racist they learn it from somewhere, but they can unlearn it as they grow older. She speaks on the racism on drugs that are used by black people, those laws are racist. For example, black people in America go to jail for having drugs such as marijuana and their sentence is extremely wrong for the possession of this drug compared to a white person possessing the same drug can be let out with a warning. She speaks of technologies be used to create a better world but still speaks about the racism and discriminated in technologies. She gives an example of an experiment from years ago where the soap only targeted the white person over the black person. Automatically stating this technology is claiming that black people are not clean. She also speaks of how black people are ignored when coming to the hospital. There is a race neutral algothrims which is dangerous. The system spends less on black patients from doctors and nurses. The hospital or medical system spends money on people with insurance and not people who need the medical assistance. The history of deadly data to create weapons with racial intentions but those type of people think they are making the world better when it brings destruction. For example, she uses the Holocaust as an example of evil data to terminate another race using technology and weapons created at that time. We have been groomed to be users and consumers in terms of technological work and we have to be more than individual users with great experience. She speaks on the imagination of having the good life which is shown n technologies to tempt the users. The podcasters reflect on the bad things about racism and avoiding the increase of racism. She speaks of the racism in California. She speaks on black lives matter and racial profiling. In my opinion she is right because there are some news articles claiming the racist hate crimes in California have increased by 31% in 2020. She mainly speaks about racism in the sciences. Technology that brings harm is not a friend to humanity given the human history. (Benjamin, 2021)</p>
