	<h1>Nandipha Zulu: Art Consultant and Part-Time Student</h1>
	<h2>Character Description and Image:</h2>
    <img src="images/Character Profile Picture.png">
	<h2>I am an part time Art Consultant in an art gallery located in Johannesburg who also studies Digital Arts at Wits University.</h2>
	<h2>I currently work part-time at Gallery Momo as a junior Art Consultant if interested in any art avaliable in the Gallery please contact me with the information in my contact page. I am currently studying Digital Art and promoting new digital artists because I believe digital art is a new modern day art form that people need to be aware of. There are examples of digital artwork on my creative blogs section. </h2>	
	<h2>Character Rationale</h2>
	<section>

			<background-colour>= rgb:"#C8A2C8";</background-colour>
			border: 2px, bgcolor="#C8A2C8" ;
		}
	<div class="box">
	<p>I created this website for my character, Nandipha Zulu also known as Nandi. Nandi is a 24 year old young woman from Durban who currently stays in Johannesburg. She is a part-time junior art consultant and part-time student at Wits University. I created this character using Raven from Teen Titans as a persona and in terms of my character's favorite colours.
		My character is an artist in her own time that is why she is passionate about art but this inspired by my own personal interest in art. Nandipha is from the Zulu tribe, which is why her name is Nandipha. It is a Zulu name, she comes from a Zulu family. I made this a factor because I am Zulu myself and it is better making my character a tribe I'm fully famaliar with instead of making her a different
		tribe. I did this because I dont want to use a different tribe and disrespect their cultures and traditions or explain it wrong. It was a respectful decision.

		My character is a development of my own personality but mostly inspired by Raven from DC. Raven was an introvert and she seemed scary and does not care about anything unless it interests her which is exactly how my character is. She loves reading and doing artistic things but dresses like an Insta-baddie. I created the Creative Blogs to explain Nandi's interests in Art and her life in Johannesburg. It explains her favorite interests.
		The colour theme of my character's website and way of dressing is suppose to be artistic and gothic and radiate this type of energy. I drew an image of charcater for a better character description and show what type of clothes she is into. I wanted her to dress casual because she is working and is suppose to look a bit professional but at the same time she wears casual clothes because she is not that strict. I used my own interest in Digital 
		to help develop my character's interest in artwork but she mainly works on Fine Arts. I wanted my charcater to be a bit like girls her age during these times of social media, using my knowledge of what artists do on social media platforms. For example, she is an artist but she spends most of her time in coffee shops. I feel like this is a perfect lifestyle for someone who is introvert but has to interact with the city, visiting coffee shops and restaurants 
		because no one can bother her but she is still interacting the city and exploring different places.

		Honestly it is easier to create this character using my own personal interests and using a ficitonal character for inspration in terms of the colour theme.

	<h3>Why is Nandi a part-time Art Consultant?</h3>
	<p>Nandi is a part-time art consultant because she loves artwork and also loves learning the history of artworks and explaining it to customers or potential buyers. She is very passionate about Art but mainly she works part-time in the Art gallery to earn some money. The art gallery is like her second home and she feels at peace being surround by different types of creativity.</p>
	<h3>Why is Nandi a part-time Student?</h3>
	<p>Nandi is a part-time student because she wants to learn the digital art medium as she believes it is the future of Art. Things are done digitally especially with Covid living among us. Drawing is one of her hobbies and she is currently learning how to draw digitally on her laptop. So far is she very inspired and interested in different digital artwork by different people around the world.</p>
	<h3>Why is she staying in Johannesburg although she's from Durban?</h3>
	<p>Nandi likes travelling, she doesnt like staying in one place for a long time and she has been in Durban most of her life so she moved to Johannesburg to have a different type of scenery. Johannesburg is more peaceful for her than Durban because she is living on her own. Also the art scenery in Durban is not as big in Durban as it is in Johannesburg so it gives more opportunities for her.</p>
	<h3>Why does she like Art?</h3>
	<p>Nandi has always loved art since she was a child and her mother always encouraged her to draw and do art and try her best so she tries to find different types of art medium. </p>
	<h3>Why is Nandi not an influencer?</h3>
	<p>Although Nandi has the potential to become an influencer because she keeps up with the latest fashion trends on social media. She rather do her own thing and not feel pressured to become an influencer even though most influencers are actually fashion bloggers and makeup artists. Nandi is an artist at heart.</p>
