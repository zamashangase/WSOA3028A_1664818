	<h1>Nandipha Zulu: Art Consultant and Part-Time Student</h1>
    <img src="images/Character Profile Picture.png">
	<h2>I am an part time Art Consultant in an art gallery located in Johannesburg who also studies Digital Arts at Wits University.</h2>
	<h2>I currently work part-time at Gallery Momo as a junior Art Consultant if interested in any art avaliable in the Gallery please contact me with the information in my contact page. I am currently studying Digital Art and promoting new digital artists because I believe digital art is a new modern day art form that people need to be aware of. There are examples of digital artwork on my creative blogs section. </h2>	
	<h2>Character Rationale</h2>
	<h3>Why is Nandi a part-time Art Consultant?</h3>
	<p>Nandi is a part-time art consultant because she loves artwork and also loves learning the history of artworks and explaining it to customers or potential buyers. She is very passionate about Art but mainly she works part-time in the Art gallery to earn some money. The art gallery is like her second home and she feels at peace being surround by different types of creativity.</p>
	<h3>Why is Nandi a part-time Student?</h3>
	<p>Nandi is a part-time student because she wants to learn the digital art medium as she believes it is the future of Art. Things are done digitally especially with Covid living among us. Drawing is one of her hobbies and she is currently learning how to draw digitally on her laptop. So far is she very inspired and interested in different digital artwork by different people around the world.</p>
	<h3>Why is she staying in Johannesburg although she's from Durban?</h3>
	<p>Nandi likes travelling, she doesnt like staying in one place for a long time and she has been in Durban most of her life so she moved to Johannesburg to have a different type of scenery. Johannesburg is more peaceful for her than Durban because she is living on her own. Also the art scenery in Durban is not as big in Durban as it is in Johannesburg so it gives more opportunities for her.</p>
	<h3>Why does she like Art?</h3>
	<p>Nandi has always loved art since she was a child and her mother always encouraged her to draw and do art and try her best so she tries to find different types of art medium. </p>
	<h3>Why is Nandi not an influencer?</h3>
	<p>Although Nandi has the potential to become an influencer because she keeps up with the latest fashion trends on social media. She rather do her own thing and not feel pressured to become an influencer even though most influencers are actually fashion bloggers and makeup artists. Nandi is an artist at heart.</p>
