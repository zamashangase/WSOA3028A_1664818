	<h1>Digital Artworks I find interesting</h1>
	<h1>Name of Art: Gender-Based Violence in South Africa by Luyanda Sade</h1>
	<img src="images/Gender Base Violence Art.png">
	<p>This artwork is dedicated to the victims of gender based violence in South Africa. Although this is not all of the victims this artwork was created in June 2020 and it represents women in South Africa being endangered. The red line painted in the woman's face represents no identity instead she represents all women. The names are written all over her body and the background represents the random places the victims were found.</p>
    <h1>Name of Art: Before Love Came To Kill Us by Luyanda Sade</h1>
	<img src="images/Jessie Reyez Art.png">
	<p>This artwork is inspired the musician Jessie Reyez who released an album called "Before Love Came To Kill Us" this music inspired the artist when the artist was in a dark place that is too personal to explain or talk about. The album speaks of love and loss as well as having very dark visuals which inspired the theme of the artwork. The butterflies represent freedom. The eyes represent wanting to forget.</p>
	<h1>Favorite Artists and artworks</h1>
    <p>My favorite artists are Van Gogh and Michealangelo.</p>
    <p>My favourite artwork by Van Gogh is Starry Night, that painting has a very mysterious yet calming effect on me. I'm obsessed with the beautiful patterns and the different shades of blue.
    My favourite artworks by Michealangelo are the Pietta and the Madonna of Bruges. This is because I was raised in a very religious household and although I dont see myself as an extremely religious person
    I like the beauty of these sculptures and the extremely detailed features. I'm a Roman Catholic and we believe in prayering the rosary which is used to pray to Mary so she can talk to Jesus about our prayers.
    These sculptures remind of my religion but also give me faith in God and I've been interested and amazed by renaissance art. That's because I believe the Renaissance Era was an Era where artists were allowed to express themselves and experiment with different colours and mediums.
    Personal Thought: I always wondered if women in the Renaissance Era were allowed to be painters or did society suppress them and only saw women as the muses for male painters. I also wonder if history has hidden many talented female artists.

    <section>
        <h1>My Favorite Social Platforms</h1>
        <p>I usually use Instagram because I think it is the best platform to post and search for artworks and discover new artists that use different mediums.
            by mediums I mean paint, pen, pencil, digital illustrations and other mediums. I use Twitter to catch up with news, twitter is basically my version of the news
            I dont tweet but I retweet a lot of things I like. My instagram handle is @NandiTheZuluQueen and my Twitter handle is @QueenNandi
        </p>

    <h1>My Secret Tattoos</h1>
    <p>Like I said the About Section. I am obsessed with tattoos. I actually have tattoos that you cant see unless I wear vests or skirts.
        That's why I call them secret tattoos because they are hidden. My first tattoo is a butterfly on my thigh. My second tattoo is a red rose.
        Fun Fact: These tattoos symbolise people in my life who are no longer on this earth.
    </p>
    <h1>Favorite types of Books</h1>
	<p>I usually enjoy reading mangas and books that have adventure and where the girl is the main character. I grew up enjoying reading books where the girl is the main character because these books
		felt relatable.
