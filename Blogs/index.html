<p>The Library of Babel:
   In the beginning of this reading, the author considers the universe as a composed hexagonal gallery that has infinite numbers, and the universe is also called the Library.  In this library there are twelve bookshelves. The author describes the bookshelves and talks about men of the library back in his days. The libraries are considered a sphere with hexagon shaped centers, each hexagon is furnished with five different bookshelves. Each book is different, but thirty-two books have identical formats and contains four hundred and ten pages. Each page of the books has forty lines and exactly eight black lines. The front of each book has letters. The library has always existed. It is considered a future eternity of the world to the author. Man is the imperfect librarian in a universe with appointments that are elegant in it’s bookshelves. The library has staircases for it’s travelers and readers, a seat for the librarian as well as the water closets. This library is the perfect handwork of God.
     There is a theory about the Library. It is believed that the ancient people were librarians that created a language. This reading firstly discusses the universe as a place of knowledge and mankind as readers, preservers and protectors of this place of knowledge. The reading constantly speaks of the hexagon symbol having an importance use in the reading and the Library itself. The reading then goes on in how to find books and praying to an unknown god that someday that book will be read by someone. Someone believe that the library is nonsense.
    The Garden of Forking Paths:
    This is a book that can read in multiple ways by the reader and the storyline comes in seven layers. The author describes the theory of the universe in this book. The author describes the universe as a place where everything is possible and that it is philosophy with motivated actions represented by the protagonist of the book. The book speaks about issues such as race, espionage, war, ancestry, and other historical events.

    The Library of Babel
    It is said that methodical components and compositions distract the author from the current condition of humanity then the author speaks of the distress of mankind and the extinction of these books as time goes on. If a traveler were to travel in any direction, he would find out that the end of journey will have the same repeated history and discord.
    
   Conclusion 
    In conclusion the library of Babel speaks of the fear of losing ancient discoveries and knowledge in books from the infinite universal library and of mankind being doomed to repeat the same discord.  but also speaks beautifully of the mysteries of the universe found in this library and it’s books as well as mankind serving as travelers and librarians. The Garden of Forking Paths has been compared and has similar concepts in terms of speaking about the beauty of books and the knowledge that they have. Both described as universes,  where everything is possible and the historical events as well as ancestry of ancient mankind are both noticed in both books

    <p>The reflection on one of the historical articles provided:
        This reading by Simon Harper is about Bush’s ‘As We Think at 65’ and his research on his digital idea for future technologies. The reading discusses that it has been 65 years since the visionary paper of Vannevar Bush which was published and became a new field of study for the new generation that wish to study writing, art, and computer science. The reading goes into detail about Bush’s backstory before he created the As We Think at 65 reading at the age of 35. Bush was surveying his Differential Analyzer at MIT in the year 1927. This analyzer was a computer that had the ability to solve different equations with at least 18 different variables. This computer was one of the first mechanical devices that could be used operationally. Although Bush was developing his analyzer, he refused to move to digital technologies even though it was being developed in the same institution he was working in. This was because his mindset was merely focused on the physical linkage and change which is why he preferred MEMEX, a system which relied and focused on physical analogue. Bush speaks about a futuristic device for individuals that can be used as a personal and private library. MEMEX helps stores an individual’s books, communications as well as his records. Bush’s idea has said to be the first inspiration for the World Wide Web as it was written in his article in 1945 by the Atlantic Monthly. Bush wanted his computer system to help humanity and he wanted the computer to be able to adapt to humanity needs and serve humanity. Bush’s idea is to make his technology understand the human mind. The web provides human with massive amount of information. In ‘As We Think at 65’, Bush shows how information can be managed based on each individual’s experience. Bush states that science is a simple faith and that it is a privilege that mankind has the ability to learn and understand.
       
The promise and peril of User Generated Content:
User generated content fall under these three categories, videos, pictures, or texts. User generated content can be blog posts like this one. Video content, Q&A forums, case studies, reviews, and social media content. It is content created by any user online such as Instagram posts and tweets from Twitter. User generated content can be use for strategic marketing and gain control over your brand and image. For example, brands use Instagram to promote and share images of their products and influencers get paid by brands whenever they promote their products on their social media pages. User generated content can be used as marketing campaigns, it can also be used to provide people with news that has not be announced on news or make people aware of what is happening in the world. This gives people access to different types of information and different opinions from different people about different topics. Reviews help people see the results of the product from previous users and whether they had  a positive or negative experience with that product.

    <p>Sematic Markup- what is it? And why is it necessary?
        The semantic markup is the use of the markup language, for example the HTML. It contains information about different elements and the meaning behind each element in a document. It also has a selection of markup elements and it separates the markup from the visual presentation of the elements that are in the documents. The semantic markup is very necessary for the HTML elements which also enhances the searchability, accessibility, interoperability, and internationalization. Therefore, the semantic markup is mandatory if you want visitors to have access to your website. This also includes access for visitors around the world and to achieve the high search engine ranking. It also interfaces with other web pages and web services. When writing a semantic markup, you are creating web content that is readable to computers and human beings. The computer now can analyze the content written, it then delivers it and then index it and developers can put together different information into web services that are new.
        The word Semantic, refers to the meaning of a word or sentence and it’s interpretation.  When a word is misused then it is not being used semantically. The semantic markup is linked to the one of many HTML tags, it contains information about the opening and closing tags.  Even with very good CSS it still makes a bad markup invisible to the website visitors. But even styling will not make the bad markup meaningful to visitors that are computerized such as the browser translation tools, assistive technologies such as the screen readers and the search engine web crawlers. There are two practices that can enable the semantic markup and must be put into place. The first practice requires the semantic markup and it’s HTML elements to be used according to their main purpose. The second practice requires the semantic markup to separate the presentation and the content. 
        What is a browser and how does they work?
A browser is a piece of software used to give humans access to the internet. It contains a variety of human knowledge and information. Browser grants people access to browse any website and helps navigate users to any other websites available to the public. An example of a popular browser is Google Chrome. The web browser works by sending information or data and receiving it. The data is then transferred using the http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) this method helps observe things that have been texted, images and videos that have been transported around the world wide web. Browsers also send and receive information by using the backsend. The backsend sends people’s requests across the internet and carries the information that was received back is then connected and interacts with the websites that people want to visit. To display the information visually onto computers, the browser will feature a user interface which is also known as the frontend.  Which allows people to click, scroll and navigate around websites

    <p>How Does The Medium Is The Message Impact Our Understanding of the Web?
        Firstly, the medium is the message by McLuhan was created before he, the author predicted the creation of the World Wide Web thirty years before it was invented. It helps understand the medium of the internet which is an extension of ourselves as human beings. The web serves as a form of communication with mediums such as emails, social media applications and websites.  McLuhan states that people are prone to use social media as a medium that can be used as scapegoat for the sins of those in front of their technology screens. Therefore, this reading shows the people have a form of power over technologies and what they use it for, whether they use their social media and other mediums for good use or for guilt, pleasure and evil. An example for evil use of the Web id the Dark Web which uses the internet for illegal uses such as selling illegal weapons and other sells that are harmful to other human beings. How you as a user use the internet is up to you but there are consequences to users that use the Web for negative impact towards others. It is common for human beings to develop mental breakdowns when trying to process new information as a result to adapting to times changing including new technology adaptions and creations. Technology has changed the way we communicate with others; it is way for human beings to send messages faster than before. Messages are instantly delivered but the way the message is written is important otherwise it might be perceived in the wrong context for example some people who are used to emojis expressing how they feel will perceive a message being sent without emojis means that the person who sent the message is being serious or lacks a sense of humor depending on the topic being discussed. The word content is important when interacting on the internet because no one can fully understand how you feel through the messages. Messages change the concept and changes the impact of the shape and content it was delivered. We as human beings miss the structural impact the messages as a medium have on our social and professional affairs. For example, when sending an email that is work related you must sound professional and serious compared to an email that you send to a family and friends. The scholar is trying to address the impact of how messages effect our way of communicating and that the internet can be used for good and evil purposes, but both still have consequences depending on the subject matter of the conversation. The scholar is implying that we as human must use the internet in a responsible manner and with great power comes great responsibility. The internet is our new source of information as well as communication. The key arguments of the article is the impact of the internet has on society and how it dominates our way of living as well as interaction with other people.

    <p>What interactivity means to the www
        Before going into what interactivity means to the world wide web, we need to have an understanding of the world wide web. The world wide web is a comprehensive example of a hypermedia system. Hypermedia systems are based on the same model of information spaces that are collections of resources that are interlinked.
        According to Aaron Smuts, something is only interactive only if it responsive, is not completely controlled, does not completely controlled, and doesn’t respond in a random fashion. Authors such as Lev Manovich and Espen Aarseth both try to avoid the word ‘interactive’ in their readings. Aarseth prefers to use the word ‘ergodic’ and defines interactive or ergodic literature as texts where effort is required in order for the reader to traverse the text. Lev Manovich avoids the word interactive because the concept for the word is too broad and useful. An object is represented in a computer and then becomes interactive. Meaning that when you put something on the internet then it becomes a part of the world wide web. But calling computer media interactive is meaningless, this means that stating the simple facts about computers. User input results in output such as events. An example of an event is the user interface events. These events occur as the given results of any interactions with the browser window instead of the HTML page. It resizes and scrolls.
        The second event is the Mouse event. These types of events only fire when the mouse moves and also when the user clicks a button. Although these actions work differently depending on the types of touchscreen devices. For the mouse events the movement of the mouse itself involves clicking, double clicking, mouse down, mouse up, mouse over, mouse move and mouse out. From my understanding the use of the mouse is important towards interacting with the world wide web as this device helps the user move around the world wide web. 
        The third event is the Keyboard events. This event fires on any type of device when the computer user interacts with a keyboard.  The most important buttons on the keyboard during interactions are the input, keypress, key up and the key down. These buttons also help with movement around the World wide web.
        The fourth event is the Form events. These events are considered common when using forms on the webpages. The one that we are looking at in particular is the submit event which mostly comes in forms of validation also known as checking form values. The form event process includes submitting, change and input.
        All these user events are not the same or equal. But they are indeed responsive, respond in a non-random way. Users should care about this procedure because we are in business with manipulation. This manipulation includes controlling your user, creating meaning, subvert meaning and the manipulation of directing their actions as well as dictating their actions.
        In conclusion in my opinion, interactivity helps users move around the world wide web in order to go where they want to go including visiting webpages. These events are important in the interactivity process, in a way they are a form of direction and navigation for users to reach their destination.
