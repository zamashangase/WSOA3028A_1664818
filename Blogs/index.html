<p>The Library of Babel:
    In the beginning of this reading, the author considers the universe as a composed hexagonal gallery that has infinite numbers, and the universe is also called the Library.  In this library there are twelve bookshelves. The author describes the bookshelves and talks about men of the library back in his days. The libraries are considered a sphere with hexagon shaped centers, each hexagon is furnished with five different bookshelves. Each book is different, but thirty-two books have identical formats and contains four hundred and ten pages. Each page of the books has forty lines and exactly eight black lines. The front of each book has letters. The library has always existed. It is considered a future eternity of the world to the author. Man is the imperfect librarian in a universe with appointments that are elegant in it’s bookshelves. The library has staircases for it’s travelers and readers, a seat for the librarian as well as the water closets. This library is the perfect handwork of God.
     There is a theory about the Library. It is believed that the ancient people were librarians that created a language. This reading firstly discusses the universe as a place of knowledge and mankind as readers, preservers and protectors of this place of knowledge. The reading constantly speaks of the hexagon symbol having an importance use in the reading and the Library itself. The reading then goes on in how to find books and praying to an unknown god that someday that book will be read by someone. Someone believe that the library is nonsense.

    Conclusion 
    In conclusion the library of Babel speaks of the fear of losing ancient discoveries and knowledge in books from the infinite universal library and of mankind being doomed to repeat the same discord.  but also speaks beautifully of the mysteries of the universe found in this library and it’s books as well as mankind serving as travelers and librarians. The Garden of Forking Paths has been compared and has similar concepts in terms of speaking about the beauty of books and the knowledge that they have. Both described as universes,  where everything is possible and the historical events as well as ancestry of ancient mankind are both noticed in both books
