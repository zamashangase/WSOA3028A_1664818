<p>The Library of Babel:
   In the beginning of this reading, the author considers the universe as a composed hexagonal gallery that has infinite numbers, and the universe is also called the Library.  In this library there are twelve bookshelves. The author describes the bookshelves and talks about men of the library back in his days. The libraries are considered a sphere with hexagon shaped centers, each hexagon is furnished with five different bookshelves. Each book is different, but thirty-two books have identical formats and contains four hundred and ten pages. Each page of the books has forty lines and exactly eight black lines. The front of each book has letters. The library has always existed. It is considered a future eternity of the world to the author. Man is the imperfect librarian in a universe with appointments that are elegant in it’s bookshelves. The library has staircases for it’s travelers and readers, a seat for the librarian as well as the water closets. This library is the perfect handwork of God.
     There is a theory about the Library. It is believed that the ancient people were librarians that created a language. This reading firstly discusses the universe as a place of knowledge and mankind as readers, preservers and protectors of this place of knowledge. The reading constantly speaks of the hexagon symbol having an importance use in the reading and the Library itself. The reading then goes on in how to find books and praying to an unknown god that someday that book will be read by someone. Someone believe that the library is nonsense.
    The Garden of Forking Paths:
    This is a book that can read in multiple ways by the reader and the storyline comes in seven layers. The author describes the theory of the universe in this book. The author describes the universe as a place where everything is possible and that it is philosophy with motivated actions represented by the protagonist of the book. The book speaks about issues such as race, espionage, war, ancestry, and other historical events. 
    These two books were compared to each other and have similar ideas. The reading continues speaking about the events in the book or storyline.
    The Library of Babel
    It is said that methodical components and compositions distract the author from the current condition of humanity then the author speaks of the distress of mankind and the extinction of these books as time goes on. If a traveler were to travel in any direction, he would find out that the end of journey will have the same repeated history and discord.
    
   Conclusion 
    In conclusion the library of Babel speaks of the fear of losing ancient discoveries and knowledge in books from the infinite universal library and of mankind being doomed to repeat the same discord.  but also speaks beautifully of the mysteries of the universe found in this library and it’s books as well as mankind serving as travelers and librarians. The Garden of Forking Paths has been compared and has similar concepts in terms of speaking about the beauty of books and the knowledge that they have. Both described as universes,  where everything is possible and the historical events as well as ancestry of ancient mankind are both noticed in both books

<h1>Week2: Blog Post</h1>
    <p>The reflection on one of the historical articles provided:
        This reading by Simon Harper is about Bush’s ‘As We Think at 65’ and his research on his digital idea for future technologies. The reading discusses that it has been 65 years since the visionary paper of Vannevar Bush which was published and became a new field of study for the new generation that wish to study writing, art, and computer science. The reading goes into detail about Bush’s backstory before he created the As We Think at 65 reading at the age of 35. Bush was surveying his Differential Analyzer at MIT in the year 1927. This analyzer was a computer that had the ability to solve different equations with at least 18 different variables. This computer was one of the first mechanical devices that could be used operationally. Although Bush was developing his analyzer, he refused to move to digital technologies even though it was being developed in the same institution he was working in. This was because his mindset was merely focused on the physical linkage and change which is why he preferred MEMEX, a system which relied and focused on physical analogue. Bush speaks about a futuristic device for individuals that can be used as a personal and private library. MEMEX helps stores an individual’s books, communications as well as his records. Bush’s idea has said to be the first inspiration for the World Wide Web as it was written in his article in 1945 by the Atlantic Monthly. Bush wanted his computer system to help humanity and he wanted the computer to be able to adapt to humanity needs and serve humanity. Bush’s idea is to make his technology understand the human mind. The web provides human with massive amount of information. In ‘As We Think at 65’, Bush shows how information can be managed based on each individual’s experience. Bush states that science is a simple faith and that it is a privilege that mankind has the ability to learn and understand.
