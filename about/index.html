    <h1>Hi I'm Nandi and this is what I want you to know</h1>
    <p>My full name is Nandipha Zulu, and yes I was named after one of South Africa's most famous Zulu Queens.
I'm twenty four years old and I'm originally from Durban. I currently live in Joburg.
    </p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I love different types of art. 
        I'm a painter myself. If I'm not painting I'm usually listening music and reading 
        a book. I'm a bit of a goth and dont like socializing that much. I love watering my plants and riding my motorcycle. </p>
     <h2>My Job</h2>
        <p>Well not many people know me in the city because I'm more of an indoor person
            but I'm an art consultant for a rich families here in Joburg. I usually spend time
            at the front of my laptop and get phone calls from work telling me what do I think about 
            art pieces from different South African artists and whether any clients would be interested 
            in these specific artworks. It's really fun since I get to look at different artworks and try and 
            feel the depth and emotions through the paintings. But I hope these rich families see the beauty of these
            artworks instead of thinking of it as new house decorations but hey a girl's gotta get paid lol.
