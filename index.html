    <h1>Favorite Artists and artworks</h1>
    <p>My favorite artists are Van Gogh and Michealangelo.</p>
    <p>My favourite artwork by Van Gogh is Starry Night, that painting has a very mysterious yet calming effect on me. I'm obsessed with the beautiful patterns and the different shades of blue.
    My favourite artworks by Michealangelo are the Pietta and the Madonna of Bruges. This is because I was raised in a very religious household and although I dont see myself as an extremely religious person
    I like the beauty of these sculptures and the extremely detailed features. I'm a Roman Catholic and we believe in prayering the rosary which is used to pray to Mary so she can talk to Jesus about our prayers.
    These sculptures remind of my religion but also give me faith in God and I've been interested and amazed by renaissance art. That's because I believe the Renaissance Era was an Era where artists were allowed to express themselves and experiment with different colours and mediums.
    Personal Thought: I always wondered if women in the Renaissance Era were allowed to be painters or did society suppress them and only saw women as the muses for male painters. I also wonder if history has hidden many talented female artists.
